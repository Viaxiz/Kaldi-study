# Note:
This is a practise for learning kaldi,and it is created by [kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/) offical guideline.
I did it very little,just accomplished "Kaldi for Dummies tutorial" and so on.
And it is so funny,I wish I have more time to do it more and study it more.
Ok,if u are a fans about kaldi,welcome communication with me by email:viaxizhong@163.com.
And if u have some problem with my project,welcome contact with me.
Thanks.
By the way,if you are Chinese native,please read the doxc,may be helpful.Good Luck.
